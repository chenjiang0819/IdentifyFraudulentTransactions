You can test the code on your own machine with the following command and compare the output with test0-output.txt:  
mac: ./program < test0.txt                   /* Here ‘<’ feeds the data from test0.txt into program */  

Please use the following command to compile the code on the submission server:  
gcc -Wall -std=c99 -o program program.c  

The flag “-std=c99” enables the compiler to use a more modern standard of the C language – C99.
